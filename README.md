# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Report
📊 Hotel Booking Cancellation Report
This project presents an in-depth data analysis and visualization of hotel booking cancellations. The data was collected from hotel staff and cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Excel to extract insights that help understand booking behavior, guest profiles, and cancellation trends.

📁 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze hotel booking data to:

Understand the volume and trends in cancellations

Categorize room preferences and guest types

Identify seasonal patterns in bookings and cancellations

Provide actionable insights for hotel management to reduce cancellations

⚙️ Data Preparation & Cleaning
The raw dataset was received directly from hotel staff and included thousands of rows of hotel booking records. Key data cleaning steps included:

✅ Removing duplicate records

✅ Filtering out incomplete or invalid rows

✅ Converting data types (dates, boolean fields)

✅ Creating custom columns using formulas:

Room Status → categorized as Desired or Un-Desired based on customer preferences

Guest Type → based on age segmentation, classified into Couples, Family, or Single

📊 Dashboard Description
The dashboard was designed in Excel and includes the following components:

🔢 Total Bookings
Displays total number of bookings made over 3 years (2015–2017)

Total Bookings: 119,390

❌ Total Cancellations
Shows overall number of cancellations

Cancellation count compared across hotel types:

City Hotel: 79,330 bookings, 33,102 cancellations

Resort Hotel: 40,060 bookings, 11,122 cancellations

🛏️ Room Status Analysis
Compares bookings with cancellation count for Desired vs. Un-Desired room types

Desired Rooms: Higher bookings and cancellations

Un-Desired Rooms: Significantly fewer cancellations

📅 Monthly Trends
Line chart showing seasonal patterns:

Peak bookings during July–August

Cancellation trends remain steady with slight increase during high season

👥 Guest Type Breakdown
Categorizes bookings based on guest profiles:

Couples have the highest bookings and cancellations

Families have the lowest cancellation rate

Singles show moderate booking behavior

🧠 Key Insights
City Hotels receive more bookings but also face higher cancellation rates.

Desired rooms, while more popular, are more frequently cancelled—indicating mismatch between expectations and delivery.

Peak seasons (mid-year) have higher booking volumes, suggesting demand planning needs attention.

Guest type segmentation helps identify loyal segments (Families) vs. high-risk ones (Couples).

🛠️ Tools Used
Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, formula-based column creation, dashboard visualization

Formulas Used:

IF, AND, OR – for conditional segmentation



📌 Project Objectives Achieved
✅ Real-time reporting on cancellations

✅ Hotel-type-wise and month-wise trend analysis

✅ Behavioral segmentation of guests

✅ Dashboard easy for business users to interpret
